# machineLearning_f

welcome.
the repository is my journey in machine learning.
i write algorithms , i do my research , i implement.
note : docstrings are not complete.

project contents :


1. /supervised

1.1
/utilities:
    includes some algorithms for suprevised learning.
             
        .../preprocessing.py:
	    preprocessing algorithms such as "split train and test" and standardazition,etc.
	.../models.py:
	    main file. includes some macine learning alogrithms such as gradient descent.

1.2
/Regression:
    includes implementation of regression models. 
	
	.../linear/example:
	    linear regression example in which there is an estimation of co2 emission of a group of cars.
	.../logistic/example:
	    binary classification with logistic regression, which includes two subfiles:
		- scores.ipynb : this is a very simple file. i just used it to use my own algorithms.
		- portBank.ipytnb : this is a real life project. I used more techniques here and also i used sikit learn library, instead of my own algorithms.
	note : data sets used in examples are available in 'data' folder beside each 'example' folder.


changes in version:

1.1.2:
    - various updates for algorithms.
    
1.1.1:
    - read me updated.
    - deleted house price data.

1.1.0:
    - a huge update for algorithms. I have completely changed the base of my algorithms. i also added OOP programming to combine logistic regression and linear regression in a unique class.
    - added logistic regression directory.
    - improved linear regression example.
    - replaced new algorithms with old models.
    - deleted houseprice.ipynb
    - new directory sorting.
    - bug fixes and other new features.
